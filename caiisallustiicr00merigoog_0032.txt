mnnot doubt the general correctness of the charges
against Catilina Oould they have been fairly ques·
tioned, we must suppose that Sallust, as a bitter enemy
of bis adversaries, would not have failed to suggest
some extenuation of them. On the whole Sallust’s

He is accused of undervaluing Oicero’s merit Itis
difficolt at least to fasten upon him any charge of
ouertly disparaging that statesrnan 3 though, were wc

an able and popular man, but one who, as a arew mala,

could be easily diaowned and disomded if unsuccessful,
as their instrument iu this measure. Accordingly
