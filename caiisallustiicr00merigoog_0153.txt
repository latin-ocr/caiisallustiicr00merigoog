been made in accordance with Oato'a opinion, not as il he bad '

been the only speaker on that aide, but beccum hia speech was
the most effective, and had evidently carried the point. See
Cicero to Atticus, xii. 21. cur ego iu sententiam Catonisl quia
“ verbis luculentioribus et pluribus eandem rem comprehenderat.
He insiste that Cato's merit lay in recommending his own (i. e.
Cicero's) policy, whereas M. Brutus, iu writing a panegyricon
his rincle Cato, had made it appear as if the capital punishment
had been Cato’s original suggestion. Much weight cannot be
given to Brutua's authority on this point, but it is in some degree
corroborated hythe silence of Sallust, regarditrg the part which
Cicero claimed in the business.
