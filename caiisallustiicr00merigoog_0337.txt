Florus, iii. 3, and particularly Plutarch, in his life oi Marius,
· who defeated and destroyed them in the two great battles oi
Aquae Sextiae and Vercellae.

a. Quo metu] “ln consternation at which dotat?

3· Illique, ei inde usque, eto] “Both the Romans ol
that day, and since, down to my own times.'' This harsh and

· ungrammatical sentence Kritz would emend conjecturally, by

reading itique (iq. et tum), ior illique ,· “ both then and since.’'

4. Sic habuere] “Have been convinced oi this.” Gomp.
Cic. ed Dio. xiv. ⁴· sic habeto, mi Tiro, neminem esse qui me

5. Prona] Ἥ] e a subdued,‘’ tq. saera, eeu ἶ
which it is joined, c. 80. id facilius proniusque fuit. =

6. Pro salute, etc] Oomp. Cic. da Off. i. ηι (inm

7. Absens] This was contrary to the lew, which¹ required
thet a candidate lor the consulship should appear in the forum
on three successive nundina, and-oanvass the sotera. A general
who waited ior a triumph might not enter the city, and accord·
ingly was in strietness prevented from suing for the consulship.

favour. Julius Gaesar claimed e triumph ior his rictories in
Spain as praetor, an. 694, but he was eager to obtain the consul·
ship, and was compelled to forego the coveted honour in order to
acquire the more valuable dignity. Marius was elected consul a

third, fourth, and fifth time also inhia absence, being engaged
in 'the war with the Cimbri He was consul seven times iu all.

and carried off to the Mamertino prison, under the Capitoline
hills, where he was thrown into the lowest d eon and left to
starse. Plut. Mo. 12. captive generals thus ed in triumph
were often put to death immediately afterwards, as Vercingetorix
by Oaesar, generally strangled. But in other cases they were
allowed to live. Marius was considered vainglon'ous ior entering
the senate-house in his triumphal robe, Liv. Epir. lxvii.
