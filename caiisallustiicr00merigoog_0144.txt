11. Ubi ad eum ventum] There was much irregularity
in the order in which o iniens were demanded in the senate, The

consul (or prator in ' absence) who summoned the meeting,
called upon all the members separetely to declare their senti·¹
ments, which they did either in a speech, or by merely assenting
to the opinion of some preceding speaker ; in which case they
rose from their place, and went over to him. At the conclusion
oi the debete, the grou thus assembled were counted. Comp.
Plin Ep. viii 14 19. ex aperte jubet dirimi debere sententias
occidentis et relegentis, cum ita discessionem fieri jubet ; qui
hnec sentitis in hanc partem, qui elia omnia in illam partem ite,
aasentitis...i.e. in eam in qua sedet qui censuit relegandos.
e consul mually called first upon one of the consuls designate,
next upon the consulare, the praetors, and other high magistrates.
But he was not bound to any particular order; and in the pre·
sent csse we find Catulus, a consular, speaking aiter Ooesar, who
’was prator-designate. But whatever order· the consul assigned
at the commeneement oi his term oi office, he was expected to
maintain throughout. Oaesar’a violating thia usage, in his own
consulship, was remarked upon. See Suet. Jol. 21. post noram
affinitatem, Pompeium primum rogare seutentiam coepit, cum
Crassum soleret; essetque consuetudo, ut quem ordinem inter·
rogandi sententias consul kalendis januariis instituisset, eum toto
anuo conservaret. On thie occasion it seems that Crassus was
not present, otherwise Sallust, or Cicero himself, would undoubt-
edly have recorded his opinion. He was indignant, perhaps, at
the suspicion oi complicity cast upon him. Many of the senators
1 abstained from attending, from various metues comp. Oic. tn
