NOI'ES. 95

11. Mannum mercede] “With the weges of manual
labour.” Oorup. Virg. AEn. viii. 409. Cui tolerare colo vitam
tenuique Minerva

12· Privatis atque publicis largitionibus] te. dutu-
butions oi corn, orl, or wine, made by rich patrous to their
clients; or by candidates for office, or actual magistrates, to the
people. Thus Crassus, after the defeat of Spartacus, when suing
ior the consulship, nu. 683, feasted tho Roman people at ten
thousand tables. Public largesses had been given oocasionally,
and C. Gracchus introduced the sale ol corn at low fixed prices to
the citizens; but M. Cato first advised a regular gratuitous distri·
bution, in the hope oi withdrawing the needy citizens from the
influente ol the demagogues. The lurgess (live bushels, Sall. Fr.
Hier.) was given monthly, Suet. Oct. 40.

13. Praetulerat] Depending upon quae, astobroverat.

14. an] Scil. juncera, understood in juventus: the con·
structionis broken, juventus being a nomin. absolute.

suae atque hostium vitae juxta pepercerant.

16. ,Ius libertatis imminutum] “Treated as if they wera
neither citizens nor· freemen,” ie. deprived of tho privileges oi the

constitution. The families of the proscribed were incapacitated
for holding public office by a Lex Cornelia, nu. 673· Vell. ii. 28.
exclusique paternis opibus liberi etiam petendorum honorum jure
prohiberentur, simulque quod indignissimum est, senatorum filii
st onera ordinis sustinerent et J'ura perderent The rehabilitation
of these persons was agitated for many years3 defeated by Cicero
in his consulship3 and at last effected by Caesar as dictator. See
Plutarch, Ooes. 37 (a. u. 705); Suet. Jus. 75.

17· Aliarum atque renati] Aba and ac are used after
words oi oomparison, e. g. edem, porr, cantuaritarum, per·
inde, aliter, secam where the sense can only be rendered in
English by “aa” or “than’' Ut, however, sometimes occurs
with atquc, as Oic. in Verr. i. 46. aliter atque ut edixerat3 from
which it may be surmised that the copula of comparison bas·
dropped out of the idiom3 and that atque had originally its
proper sense of “immediately‚” “just ;” e. g tic sarit idem atque
(guod) epo, “he does just the same asIdo.’ ⁴ '

18. 'Id adeo malum] Emphatic, “that evil, then;’' or
“that evil, great as it was :'' namely, the inveterate jealousy of
the commone towards the sonate, dating at least from the times
ol the Gracchi, sixty or seventy years before.
